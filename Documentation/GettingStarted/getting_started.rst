Getting started with the Research PACS
======================================

Getting started with Notion is straightforward.  After :ref:`installation <Installation>` of Notion, an instance should be up and running at http://localhost:11118. **NB:** links on this page reference :tt:`http://localhost:11118` and can be visited if Notion is running on the local machine.

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce several of Notion's concepts including :ref:`Pools`, :ref:`Devices`, and :ref:`Anonymization`.  Once a simple :ref:`Pool <Pools>` is configured, test images will be sent to the Pool, both with and without anonymization.  The second step will be to move images between two pools to simulate the :ref:`multi-researcher / multi-pool <MultiResearcherUseCase>`.

Create a Pool
