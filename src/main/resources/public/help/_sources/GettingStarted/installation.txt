Installation
============

After downloading Notion and unzipping, look in the ``Notion-x.x.x`` folder (where ``x.x.x`` is the version number).  This folder contains the following items:

:tt:`Notion-x.x.x.jar`
    The Jar file with the Notion classes and runtime files bundled.

:tt:`lib`
    External Java libraries.  Must be maintained in the same directory as ``Notion-x.x.x.jar`` because the main jar file references the libraries by a relative path.

:tt:`Documentation`
    Contains this documentation

:tt:`notion.yml`
    A configuration file for Notion in `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/>`_ format.

The jar file and lib directory may be copied to any location as needed.
